Creating a certificate:
$ openssl genrsa -des3 -passout pass:x -out server.pass.key 2048
    Generating RSA private key, 2048 bit long modulus
    ....................................................................+++
    ...........+++
    e is 65537 (0x10001)
$ openssl rsa -passin pass:x -in server.pass.key -out server.key
    writing RSA key
$ rm server.pass.key
$ openssl req -new -key server.key -out server.csr
