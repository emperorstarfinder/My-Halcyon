# My-Halcyon
My Experimental grid architecture based on InWorldz/Halcyon

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is for experimentation and creation of a better architecture based on the Halcyon codebase.  It is not intended to be a replacement for Halcyon
itself.  If you are wanting to use Halcyon please use the official Halcyon codebase at: https://github.com/InWorldz/halcyon

Likewise if you find an issue with the Halcyon codebase itself please report it there.  If you are using this repository's codebase then please report issues here.  If your using the upstream
Halcyon codebase and report an issue relating to their code, the issue will be closed.

Note On as of August 15, 2018, the upstream InWorldz/Halcyon project has been moved to https://github.com/HalcyonGrid/halcyon due to the closing of InWorldz and it's successor grid Islandz.
