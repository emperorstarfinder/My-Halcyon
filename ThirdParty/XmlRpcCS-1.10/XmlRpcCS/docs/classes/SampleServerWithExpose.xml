            <summary>
             An XML-RPC server that utilizes XmlRpcExposed attribute to restrict access.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            This server registers itself as the "sample" object. This example differs from
             SampleServer in that it uses the XmlRpcExposed attribute to indicate which
             public methods are exposed via XML-RPC. Normally ALL public methods are
             considered to be exposed, but if the XmlRpcExposed attribute is present at the
            class level then ONLY public methods having the XmlRpcExposed attribute will be
            exposed.
            <para>
            Run the soc client against the two servers to see the difference. Running
            client.exe against this server should generate an error as well since it
            attempts to run a method that is not exposed.</para>
