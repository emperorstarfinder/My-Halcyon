            <remarks>
            This example class calls the system object to get a list of methods available, and
            then boxcars a collection of calls to get the signature of each of the methods
            returned in the original list.

            The Main method, the entire class is embodied in this single method. This method simply
            creates an XmlRpcRequest to system.listMethods which is sent. If all goes well a list
            of methods is returned. That list is then used to make a collection of XmlRpcRequests
            each a call to system.methodSignature. This collection of requests is not sent
            individually but instead is "boxcarred" together and sent all at once.
            <para>
            The results of the second call is a collection of results to each individual request
            bundled into an array. The array of results is then formatted for output.</para>
