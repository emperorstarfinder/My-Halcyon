            <summary>A very basic XML-RPC client example.</summary>
            <remarks>This is a basic client that calls several methods of the server including one
            intentionally bad one. One of the methods called works on the server.exe but is
            not exposed in the expose.exe, this gives you an idea of the error generated.</remarks>

            <summary><c>LoggerDelegate</c> compliant method that does logging to Console.
            This method filters out the <c>LogLevel.Information</c> chatter.</summary>

            <summary>Main application method.</summary>
            <remarks> Simply sets up logging and then an <c>XmlRpcRequest</c> instance. Then
            Calls <c>sample.Ping</c>, <c>sample.Echo</c> and <c>sample.Broken</c> in sequence.
            The <c>XmlRpcResponse</c> from each call is then displayed. Faults are checked for.
